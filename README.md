### **FHR - Fog and Haze Remover**
This was our final project. We aimed to test different types of dehazing algorithms to achieve clear image visibility under 80% fog.  
We compared traditional (manual) and machine learning-based dehazing algorithms, then developed a platform to test them in real time.
