### **FHR - Fog and Haze Remover**
This was our final project. We aimed to test different types of dehazing algorithms to achieve clear image visibility under 80% fog.  
We compared traditional (manual) and machine learning-based dehazing algorithms, then developed a platform to test them in real time.

### **HRMS - Human Resources Management System (with JFoenix)**
A software engineering project where we applied the MVC design pattern and implemented SRS use cases.  
We deployed both the back-end and front-end of the system.

### **ROOAPSEA - Research on Optimal Airline Passenger Satisfaction Estimation Algorithm**
A research project focused on finding the most effective machine learning algorithms for predicting airline passenger satisfaction.  
We analyzed multiple models and created a performance report — useful for designing ML-based satisfaction estimation systems.
